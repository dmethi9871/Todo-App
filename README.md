## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** You can download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Firebase CLI:** Install the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) globally using npm:


npm install -g firebase-tools

Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git
cd todo-list-app

2.Install Dependencies:

Inside the project directory, install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

3.Configure Firebase:

Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/.
Set up Firebase Authentication in your project.
Configure your Firebase project by running:

firebase login

4.Configure Firebase in the App:

Create a Firebase configuration file (usually named firebase.js) in your project's source code. This file should contain your Firebase project configuration details. You can find these details in your Firebase project settings.

Example firebase.js:
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
  messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
};



firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export const auth = firebase.auth();

Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase project's actual configuration.
